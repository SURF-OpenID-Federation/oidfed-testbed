This directory holds a tamplate for the condifguration of the testbed

Template examples exists for all Entity types one might want to configure. Overall configuration for the testbed is based on testbed_config.json.template 
Default values for your envirnoment may be set there. If needed platform specific values may also be set using a .env file. Alle values in the .env will overwrite the defaults in the json file when using the env2json script. The defalt docker container may be used to runn this process (see ec and tb script examples in the maun directory)
